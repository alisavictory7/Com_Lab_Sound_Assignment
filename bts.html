							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p>All team members were involved in the sound production process, notably through voice acting. Linus handled the settings of both microphones in the recording process. Linus also recorded the speeches of all team members as well as sound effects, including hospital beeps, footsteps, door opening, pencils clinking, chairs moving, paintbrushes on paper.

							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p>Of particular interest is the recreated sound of the hospital monitor beeping, which Linus attempted by reading through information on using the equipment into the sound studio. Through experimentation with the keyboard features and much trial and error, the musical note was found as a possibility for the hospital monitor beeping sound and recorded using the software in the iMac.

							<div class="blog_post_title"><h2><a href="#">‘Mix’ Room of the AudioDirector 365 displaying multiple tracks
							</a></h2></div>
							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p>The software AudioDirector 365 was used for sound editing mainly due to its ease of control as well as features to edit multiple tracks and useful options for editing single tracks. Alisa was involved in the post-recording process by compiling recorded audio and online audio for each scene, as well as editing. 

								</p>
								<p>
								Various effects on the software were essential in enhancing the sound for an immersive experience. Fade out was used to quieten the sound of clapping over time for a natural effect. Reverberances were added to vocals and music through presets. The ‘small’ preset for reverberance was used when the scene is set in a small room such as the hospital room, while the ‘medium’ preset was used in a larger room such as an indoor concert stage.

							</a></h2></div>
							<div class="blog_post_text">
								<p>Ambient sounds were researched and obtained online from freesound.org, then added to set the mood for the scene as well as a more realistic effect to the audio. For example, the sound of a crowd of people are heard on the streets in Act 1 Scene 2, a thunderstorm and rainy day sounds are heard as foreshadowing before Linda hears the news of her blindness even as she dreamt of becoming a painter in Act 2 Scene 1, the nature sounds of birds chirping are heard as foreshadowing before Linda’s teacher comes in with a gift to help her develop painting skills through listening to sounds in Act 3 Scene B1, and clapping sounds of the audience are heard in the concert in Act 3 Scene A1 and the painting exhibition in Act 3 Scene B2. To enable better flow between the thunderstorm and rain sounds, a crossfade transition was used. The thunderstorm audio was useful for dramatic effect.
